  Changes from Real-Time Maude 2.2 to version 2.3:
  ------------------------------------------------------------

     There are actually no changes, apart from the fact that
     version 2.3 is implemented by extending (the publicly
     available) version 2.3 of Duran's Full Maude. This in turn
     runs on version 2.3 of Maude.

     Notice that some new features of Maude version 2.3 
     are not reflected in the current version of Full Maude.
     This includes useful features such as rewrite bounds
     in search commands, as well as exhibiting the rewrite path
     to the (un)desired states found in searches. These features
     are therefore not included in version 2.3 of Real-Time Maude.
     (Of course, the bound on the number of rewrites is not crucial
     in Real-Time Maude, since it allows for a time bound instead.)






  Changes from Real-Time Maude 2.1 to version 2.2:
  ------------------------------------------------------------

      Fortunately, as described in the manual, there are very
      few changes from version 2.1 to version 2.2 of Real-Time Maude.
      Essentially all modules and analysis commands for 2.1 should also
      work for 2.2, so there should be little need to redo
      specifications or analyses.

      1. Adapted to Maude version 2.2 and to Full Maude version 2.2.

      2. In timed and untimed searches (and in contrast to Full Maude),
         the system now gives a "match" if an object belonging
         to a proper subclass of the class C given in the object
         pattern (otherwise) matches the pattern. In addition, 
         the object pattern no longer has to capture all attributes
         (i.e., it is no longer needed to explicitly add a variable
         of sort 'AttributeSet' to an object pattern).

      3. The addition operator _+_ is extended to the infinity value
         INF in the predefined modules NAT-TIME-DOMAIN-WITH-INF
         and POSRAT-TIME-DOMAIN-WITH-INF. 

      4. The operators 'min' and 'max' in the skeleton module TIME-INF 
         are now called 'minimum' and 'maximum'. Any module
         containing NAT-TIME-DOMAIN or POSRAT-TIME-DOMAIN can still
         use 'min' and 'max'.

      5. The new sort for the nonnegative rational numbers is
         'NNegRat' (since in Maude 2.2, and hence in Real-Time Maude 2.2, 
         PosRat denotes the non-zero positive rationals). If your
         specifications use 'NzTime' and 'Time' you should not need
         to make (m)any changes.

       Main changes from Real-Time Maude 2.0 to Real-Time Maude 2.1:

       1. Adapted to Maude version 2.1 and to Full Maude version 2.1.
      
       2. Therefore, we allow "such that" (abbreviated "s.t.") 
          conditions on the patterns in timed and search, find
          latest/earliest, and check commands. Notice that the 
          variables occurring the such conditions should be given
          explicitly of the form "VAR:SORT".

       3. The comparison operators >, >=, <, <= are extended
          to the sort TimeInf in the predefined modules
          NAT-TIME-DOMAIN-WITH-INF and POSRAT-TIME-DOMAIN-WITH-INF,
          so that numbers can be compared also with the infinity
          value INF using these comparison operators.
       
       4. The Full Maude search error is corrected on line 
          12469 below. This line corresponds to line 12118 in 
          the public distribution of full-maude.maude from April 19.

--- -----
  Change from April 30 version to May 5 version:
    - the arrow '=>' in the tsearch and utsearch commands
      is changed to the current Maude arrow for one-step
      searches, namely, the arrow '=>1'. Furthermore, the semantics
      is slightly changed in that states reachable in 0 steps are
      no longer shown as a result of '=>1'-searches.
