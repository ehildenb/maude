Ideas for FACS 2017:

Context:

  Symbolic simulation and reachability analysis

  - Component software: symbolic analysis can be useful

    As part of the motivation

    Introduce the case study from the beginning

  - Rewriting modulo SMT is a choice

    One slide for introducing rewriting as a model of computation?

    Ground analysis

Case study

  - CASH (unbounded queue)

Problem:

  Rewriting modulo SMT can have the state-explotion problem

Contribution

  Guarded terms for rewriting modulo SMT

  For CASH

  - Previously: some properties could not be verified due to the SEP

  - With guarded terms they can and can be done fast!!!

Approach

  Encode branching due to concurrecy as part of the term structure

  Benefits:

  - Of course, less branching

  - Also, fewer states terms to reach

How?

  - Symbolic terms are generalized to allow constraints as part of their
    internal term structure

  - Several guarded terms can be enconded as one guarded term

  - Show an interesting example

Demo?

  - Screenshots are more likely
