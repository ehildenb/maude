--- name: run.maude
--- reqs: prelude, full-maude, decl.maude, sortify.maude,
---       ctor-refine.maude, ctor-var-unif.maude, var-sat.maude
--- desc: This module acts an entry point for using the library;
---       all it does it load the other modules in the required
---       order.
---
---       The main function this tool exports is called var-sat()
---       which takes two arguments:
---         [a] a functional module
---         [b] a disunification problem
---
---       An example invocation:
---
---         red var-sat(upModule(MYMOD,true),
---                     'X:Var ?= 'C.Const /\
---                     'OperatorName['C1.Const,'Y:Var] != 'X:Var) .
---
---       A few things to notice:
---             [1] The syntax of meta-terms above: in particular
---                 for constants, variables, and non-constant terms
---             [2] The syntax for the disunification problems;
---                 T ?= T' is a unification literal, T != T' is
---                 a disunification literal
---             [3] The operator /\ is used to conjoin literals
---             [4] Right now, the tool does not support \/; we
---                 assume all input has been converted into
---                 DNF and each conjunction is feed in one at
---                 a time; later this restrction will be lifted
---
---       NOTE: Right now, the tool is an alpha state; that means
---             it performs very limited error checking and may
---             crash in weird ways for more complex inputs;
---             If the tool does crash, be sure to check that:
---             [1] Your input module meets the variant satisfiability
---                 requirements
---             [2] You aren't using a sort with a reserved name; right now
---                 reserved names included any symbol starting with
---                 an "#" or a "@"
---             [3] Your input problem is well-formed, i.e. for each
---                 literal T ?= T' and T != T', T and T' are both
---                 well-formed and that they are in the same connected
---                 component
