//	Class for folding variants. We keep a collection of variants that are most general so far and test
//	each inserted variant so that caller knows whether to keep exanding the variant.
//
//	To simpify the code we treat a variant as a vector of dags; we don't distinguish between the term and
//	the substitution since both will be checked for subsumption.
//
//	The caller gives each variant an index, and for each new variant gives the index of the parent variant or NONE if
//	it is the root variant search. A variants index is required to be larger than that of its parent.
//	When an existing variant is ejected by the arrival of a new variant that is more general, all of its descendents are
//	likewise ejected, just as if the search that has already taken place had been pruned.
