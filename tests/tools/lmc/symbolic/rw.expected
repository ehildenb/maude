logical model check in READERS-WRITERS-PROPS :
  < N:Nat,0 > |= []one-writer-atmost?
result:
  no counterexample found within bound 10

logical folding model check in READERS-WRITERS-PROPS :
  < N:Nat,0 > |= []one-writer-atmost?
result:
  true (complete with depth 3)

logical folding model check in READERS-WRITERS-PROPS :
  < N:Nat,0 > |= <> ~ one-writer-atmost?
result:
  counterexample found at depth 3
